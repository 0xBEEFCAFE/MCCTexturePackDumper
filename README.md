# MCC Texture Pack Dumper
A tool for viewing/dumping texture pack files (.perm.bin) from Halo The Master Chief Collection (and as it turns out, various Square Enix games? though untested.)

## Use
Load a texture pack to browse its textures, with the ability to extract single textures or the entire pack.

Texture packs can be found at `{MCC Install}\data\ui\texturepacks\`.

The box below the texture preview also provides research information like file offsets for manually modifying contents.

## Xbox One
Through this tool will open texture packs from Xbox builds of MCC, no code is in place to detile the textures, so they will appear scrambled.
Unless a third party detile solution that doesn't piggyback official DLLs comes out, things will remain this way.
If you want to make use of questionable means that you can (re)claim from other places, I find tile mode 3 or 4 can handle most textures.
Xbox One also uses unsupported texture formats in places.

## Misc
Shoutout to [SD-UltimateTexTool](https://github.com/sneakyevil/SD-UltimateTexTool) for pointing out that Triad Wars shipped with an/the official tool for creating texture packs which was helpful for further research.
